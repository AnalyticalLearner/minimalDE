# minimalDE
This is a collection of scripts and dot files which I have created, appropriated, and tweaked to minimize my desktop experience and improve my personal workflows in a terminal based environment. 

## What the project does
This project is a collection of bash scripts, dotfiles, and documented workflows which I have created and use to minimize my enteractions with the GUI and improve my desktop experience.

## Why the project is useful
The minimalDE collection is useful to minimize the mental clutter which the GUI can sometimes create.

## How users can get started with the project
Download the entire project and leverage what you feel is useful for you and your workflows. Many of these scripts can be added to yout PATH. It may be helpful to create a `bin` subdirectory in your home directory in which to store these and other scripts. 

Adding a directory to your path.

Iniitally I expect to maintain the project, contributing updates to the code as time goes on.
